#not finished yet
February 21st 2017 01:15 ( so late )
The Api was Finished (I hope so :) )
I started the unit Test but its so late, I have to sleep :p

I will try to finish all for tomorrow at the same time as to day (I have to work before :D ) :p with a surprise if I can finished sure :D

When I would finished, I will make a docker-compose file and a small architeture to launch a container easily

you would only have to type

        docker-compose build && docker-compose up

to see the result

Thank you
